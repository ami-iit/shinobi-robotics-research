Files and documentation on how to use the [Shinobi Open-Source Video Management Software](https://shinobi.video) for Robotics Research.

## Install Shinobi

First of all, select a machine that will act as a [NVR (Network Video Recorder)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_video_recorder). As Shinobi is quite an invasive software as it requires to install custom dependencies at the system level, it is extremly recommended to use a dedicated machine, and to start from a vanilla installation of Ubuntu 20.04. To install Ubuntu 20.04 on a new machine, please check the docs in https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop .

Once you installed Ubuntu 20.04 on the machine, install Shinobi following the docs in https://shinobi.video/docs/start . The recommended installation strategy ("The Ninja Way") involve downloading and executing a script from the network, so make sure that the script is not doing anything dangerous from the safety and the security point of view. For all options, choose the default choice.
